  "description": "Investigate high latency in productcatalogservice affecting frontend performance",
  "category": "RCA",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "initialPrompt": "The OTEL demo frontend is loading slowly. Users report the product listing page takes over 3 seconds to load. Use the traces in OpenSearch to identify the bottleneck in the request flow from frontend to productcatalogservice.",
  "context": [
    {
      "description": "OTEL Demo Architecture",
      "value": "Product listing flow:\n- frontend → productcatalogservice (ListProducts gRPC call)\n- frontend → recommendationservice → productcatalogservice (GetProduct calls)\n- frontend → adservice (GetAds call)\n- All traces available in otel-v1-apm-span-* index"
    },
    {
      "description": "OpenSearch Query Hints",
      "value": "Useful queries for investigation:\n- Filter by serviceName: 'productcatalogservice'\n- Look at span duration field for latency\n- Check operationName for specific operations\n- Use traceId to follow full request flow\n- Compare current p95 latency vs historical baseline"
    },
    {
      "description": "Symptom Details",
      "value": "Current observations:\n- frontend spans show 3000ms+ total duration\n- productcatalogservice.ListProducts showing 2500ms+ (normally 100ms)\n- Issue started approximately 2 hours ago\n- No recent deployments to productcatalogservice"

    "Query otel-v1-apm-span-* for productcatalogservice spans with high duration",
    "Identify ListProducts operation as the bottleneck",
    "Analyze trace waterfall to see time distribution across services",
    "Find root cause in productcatalogservice (database query, resource contention)",
    "Recommend specific fix based on trace evidence"
